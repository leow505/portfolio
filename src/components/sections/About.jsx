                        I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a background in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences,
                        focusing on software development. I enjoy building full-stack applications that solve real-world problemsâ€”
                        from organizing club events to helping lost pets find their homes.
                        <br /><br />
                        My experience spans React, Java, Spring Boot, and working with APIs and databases. I love taking on new
                        challenges, learning quickly, and turning ideas into polished, user-friendly products.
                        <br /><br />
                        When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me snowboarding during the winter season or enjoying some casual
                        gaming to unwind. I value a good balance between creativity, problem-solving, and having fun along the way.
